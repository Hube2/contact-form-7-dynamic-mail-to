# Adopt my Contact Form 7 (CF7) Plugins

I am putting my 3 CF7 plugins up for adoption.

The reasons for this are:
* I no longer use CF7 for my clients.
  * It is too difficult to use for my average client
  * It does not support the features my clients want
  * The authour of CF7 makes too many backwards compatibility breaking changes

The 3 plugins involved are:
* At WP
  * [Dynamic Select for Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-dynamic-select-extension/)
  * [Hidden Field for Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-simple-hidden-field/)
  * [Dynamic Recipient for Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-dynamic-mail-to/)
* On Github
  * [Dynamic Select for Contact Form 7](https://github.com/Hube2/contact-form-7-dynamic-select-extension)
  * [Hidden Field for Contact Form 7](https://github.com/Hube2/contact-form-7-simple-hidden-field)
  * [Dynamic Recipient for Contact Form 7](https://github.com/Hube2/contact-form-7-dynamic-mail-to)

These plugins were built to work togther
* The dynamic select to populate drop downs
* The dynamic recipient send emails to different people
* The hidden field to supply the fields that the recipient plugin needs to work

If you are interested in adopting all 3 of these plugins please open up an issue in any of the Github repos for any of these plugins. Below is how I would like to do this, if you have other ideas you can bring them up when you open the issue.

* You fork all of these repos
* You maintian, update and improve these plugins as needed an send me pull requests
* You take over supporting these plugins on Github and WP (answer questions etc)
* I will, for a short time continue to update the WP repo with your changes
* At some time in the future I will transfer ownership of the both the Github and WordPress repos to you.
