# Adopt my Contact Form 7 (CF7) Plugins

I am putting my 3 CF7 plugins up for adoption.

The reasons for this are:
* I no longer use CF7 for my clients.
  * It is too difficult to use for my average client
  * It does not support the features my clients want
  * The authour of CF7 makes too many backwards compatibility breaking changes
